# CodrutFluentDesignSystem
Codrut Fluent Design Systen, a suite of components made to mimic the Interface of Windows 11, the Fluent Design System, This is not to be confused with CodrutsVisualLibrary, as that is ajust a suite of independent components

The component package is not at a state where it can be considered finished without encountering bugs. This package is still in its **Alpha** Stage.
